# Time machine style backups using rsync
## Description

Time Machine style backups with rsync. Tested on Linux, but should 
work on any platform since this script has no operating system or 
file system specific dependencies like the original.

## Installation

	git clone https://github.com/eaut/rsync-time-backup

## Usage

```
rsync_tmbackup.sh [OPTIONS] command [ARGS]

Commands:

  init <backup_location> [--local-time]
      initialize <backup_location> by creating a backup marker file.

         --local-time
             name all backups using local time, per default backups
             are named using UTC.

  backup <src_location> <backup_location> [<exclude_file>]
      create a Time Machine like backup from <src_location> at <backup_location>.
      optional: exclude files in <exclude_file> from backup

  diff <backup1> <backup2>
      show differences between two backups.

Options:

  -s, --syslog
      log output to syslogd

  -k, --keep-expired
      do not delete expired backups until they can be reused by subsequent backups or
      the backup location runs out of space.

  -v, --verbose
      increase verbosity

  --version
      display version and exit

  -h, --help
      this help text
```

### local backup example

	# setup backup location
	rsync_tmbackup.sh init /path/to/backup

	# backup all files from source except those mentioned in the backup.exlude file
	rsync_tmbackup.sh backup /path/to/source /path/to/backup /path/to/backup/backup.exclude

### remote backup example

To backup to a remote server you need ssh key-based authentication 
between client and server. Backup source has to be local.

	# destinations must be in the form of <user>@<host>:<directory>
	rsync_tmbackup.sh backup /path/to/source user@host:/path/to/backup

#### remote shell

Certain shells have a known issue with multiple line quoting. (E.g. csh.)
If you are having issues with ssh backups, check that your default `$SHELL` 
on the remote side is set to either sh or bash. 
Bash is probably the safer choice, but sh does seem to work.

### crontab example

You can log everything to syslog by using "-s" or "--syslog".

	# backup /home at quarter past every hour to /mnt/backup
	15 * * * * rsync_tmbackup.sh -v -s -k backup /home /mnt/backup /mnt/backup/backup.exclude

### customize backup rentention times

The backup marker file is also used as configuration file 
for backup retention times. Defaults shown below can be modified if needed.

```
RETENTION_WIN_ALL="$((4 * 3600))"        # 4 hrs
RETENTION_WIN_01H="$((1 * 24 * 3600))"   # 24 hrs
RETENTION_WIN_04H="$((3 * 24 * 3600))"   # 3 days
RETENTION_WIN_08H="$((14 * 24 * 3600))"  # 2 weeks
RETENTION_WIN_24H="$((28 * 24 * 3600))"  # 4 weeks
```

## Features

### Improvements/changes compared to Laurent Cozic's version

* more priority for new backups:
  1. expire backups by moving them to an expired folder (fast!)
  2. create new backup
  3. delete old backups thereafter (slow!, all inodes have to be removed)
* shorter backup times: 
  - minimize inode deletions/creations by reusing expired backups - usually most files/inodes have not changed even compared to older backups
* backup.marker file can be used as config file
  - more flexible and configurable backup expiration windows
  - UTC & local time handling as part of backup.marker config
* flexible command line interface, new subcommands and options
  - compare to backups, initialize backup marker, ...
  - option to log to syslog

###  Unchanged

* Each backup is on its own folder named after the current timestamp. Files can be copied and restored directly, without any intermediate tool.

* Files that haven't changed from one backup to the next are hard-linked to the previous backup so take very little extra space.

* Safety check - the backup will only happen if the destination has explicitly been marked as a backup destination.

* Resume feature - if a backup has failed or was interrupted, the tool will resume from there on the next backup.

* Automatically purge old backups - within 24 hours, all backups are kept. Within one month, the most recent backup for each day is kept. For all previous backups, the most recent of each month is kept.

* "latest" symlink that points to the latest successful backup.

* The application is just one bash script that can be easily edited.
